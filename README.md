# Pampered Pets Threat Modelling Tool

This is a Python based interactive application designed to help small businesses visualise cybersecurity risks using attack trees. Users can interactively explore pre and post digitalisation threat models, adjust the likelihood of specific threats and see how those changes affect the overall business risk.

The application provides a visual, data driven way to understand how digital transformation impacts threat exposure. It supports informed decision making by making risk more visible, measurable and comparable.
